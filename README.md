#### General Idea
This project uses a genetic machine learning algorithm to control some
little _cars_. The project is a work in progress and just started, so
a lot of features are not working yet.

The screenshot below shows the current state. There are some automatic
driving _cars_, which can measure distances to their
surroundings. The distances will be used as inputs for a neural network.
Basically, the neural network should return two outputs, one for
acceleration/deceleration and the other one for turning the car...
hopefully. :P

#### Remaining Tasks:

* ~~simple moving cars~~
* race-track generator
* fitness function
* debug neural network
* fancy looking cars (image)
* probably a lot of other stuff :D
